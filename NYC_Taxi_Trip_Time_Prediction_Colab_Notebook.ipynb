        "##### In this era of hussle and bustle, everyone wants to save some time from their daily life. And for the people who wants to save some time for their relaxation or important meeting or a football match, road journeys are the main obstacles. In New York City, on an average, people spend around 54 minutes in public transports daily, and 55% among them spend above 2 hours. Average waiting time for public transports is around 13 minutes in New York City.\n",
        "##### And here comes a scenario where this average time for arrival to destination is very important. Say, somebody has a very important meeting from 11 AM and he lives around 2 KMs away from his office. Now, he has to know how he should plan his journey (whether take a walk or taxi) and when he should get out from his home etc. That's why getting an estimate of EDA time is important is many situations.\n",
        "##### Nowadays people can get that information from Google Maps or some online taxi service provider they are using.\n",
        "##### Here, I want to model that EDA time using some supervised ML models and try to get an idea of how Google, OLA, Uber etc provide those EDA times."

Also, I shall do some EDA on newly made variables and do some anomaly detection to make the model more robust.\n",
